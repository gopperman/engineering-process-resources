						<h2>Daily Stand-up</h2>
						<div class="col__container">
							<div class="col">
								<h3>Goal:</h3>
								<p>The goal of daily stand-up is to provide transparency on what each team member is working on, and for the team to identify ways that they can help with (unblock) those tasks.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col">
								<h3>Who?</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Makers:</b> Design, Developers</li>
									<li><b>Facilitators:</b> Product, Project Managers</li>

					</section>
					<section class="text__small">
						<h3>Stand-up Process</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>The facilitator brings up the Jira or Trello board for the sprint, and calls on each team member to give an update.</li>
							<li>Each team member gives a brief (1-2 minute) update on:
								<ul>
									<li>What they worked on yesterday</li>
									<li>What they plan to work on today</li>
									<li>If they are blocked on a task and need help.</li>

						<h2>Sprint Prioritization</h2>
						<div class="col__container">
							<div class="col">
								<h3>Goal:</h3>
								<p>Sprint prioritization happens once each sprint, usually during the first week of a sprint. During prioritization, we look ahead to work lined up for the near-future (the backlog) and discuss what we need to get it ready for the next sprint.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col">
								<h3>Who?</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Makers:</b> Design, Developers</li>
									<li><b>Facilitators:</b> Product, Project Managers</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section class="text__small">
						<h2>Prioritization Outcomes</h2>
						<p>During this meeting, the backlog is groomed. Each ticket:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Is placed in the backlog roughly according to priority</li>
							<li>Has clear requirements
								<ul>
									<li>any team member should be able to pick up and complete a task based on only the information in the ticket.</li>
									<li>If requirements are unclear, a product owner might need to fill in more detail.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Includes required assets: wireframes, designs, copy, images, etc.</li>
							<li>
								Has points: an estimate of the level of effort (LOE) to complete a task.
							</li>
						</ul>
								<aside class="notes">
									- Points, as a system, don't map directly to time spent on a task.
0. Throughout the week, all team members create tickets for tasks as they identify work that needs to be accomplished. For example, an engineer finds a bug, and spends 2 minutes to throw a description of it onto the backlog. 

1. Product managers come to the meeting with high-level goals about what work should be prioritized. For example, "Next sprint we really need to focus on the tickets for the asthma tutorial".

2. The facilitator pulls up the backlog and opens up each ticket, one by one.
Each ticket is briefly discussed. The team adds requirements, agrees on how something should be implemented, and estimates the level of effort (LOE).

3. If the team can't reach consensus on any of these elements, the ticket should be kicked out to an outside discussion where the blocking issues can be resolved.
If a ticket has important details missing, like assets or requirements, the stakeholders have a week before the next sprint to get those items in place.

4. If there is work that has not yet been ticketed, the team can quickly make tickets and discuss them according to step 3.

5. As we adjust to the sprint schedule, the conversation around priorities will most likely be more free-flowing and less structured. We understand that ticket requirements and similar work will not always be written in advance of the meeting. As time goes on and we add resources for product and project management, much of the work needed to make this meeting a success will happen outside of the meeting.

						<h2>Sprint Retrospective</h2>

					<section>
						<h2>Sprint Retrospective</h2>
						<div class="col__container">
							<div class="col">
								<h3>Goal:</h3>
								<p>Sprint retrospective happens once each sprint, at the very beginning or end of the sprint. During retro, we look back at the previous sprint, assess how we did as a team, and how we can improve. Remember, any part of our process is up for discussion, changes, and improvement - even the retro itself.</p>

						<h3>Sprint Retrospective Outcomes</h3>
						<ul class="text__small">
							<li>Team bonding: recognition of successes, venting frustration.</li>
							<li>
								Action items: A list of things to do to address the most important feedback from retro.
								<ul>
									<li>This could include passing feedback on to senior leadership or stakeholders, setting up a meeting to discuss a topic in-depth, changing process (e.g. trying a new format for retro), creating documentation, etc.</li>
								</ul>

						<h3>Sprint Retrospective Process</h3>
						<div class="col__container text__small">
							<div class="col">
								<h4>Sprint closing / kickoff (15m)</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>Burn down tickets</li>
									<li>Rollover unfinished tickets into next sprint</li>
									<li>Move the highest priority tickets from the backlog into the sprint</li>
									<li>Consense on scope of next sprint</li>
									<aside class="notes">
										This is usually an assessment of past velocity, mixed in with external factors, like upcoming deadlines or holidays.
									</aside>
								</ol>
							</div>
							<div class="col">
								<h4>Retrospective (45m)</h4>
								<p>The entire team does a structured activity to give semi-anonymous feedback, then discusses as a group.</p>
								<p>Laptops should be closed for this part of the meeting, except for the note taker.</p>
